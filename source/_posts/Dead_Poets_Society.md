*Dead Poets Society* emerged in a historical moment markedly different from our own. In the film, Mr. Keating places poetry, humanism, and “Carpe Diem” at the center of his pedagogy, attempting to awaken in his students an awareness of the self, of freedom, and of the meaning of life. Within the elite educational environment the film portrays, such awakening appears as a necessary act of resistance: resistance to rigid tradition, to pre-scripted life trajectories, and to spiritual domestication.

Yet when the film is revisited in a contemporary context, what it evokes is no longer simply emotion or inspiration, but a more complex hesitation—an unease. This unease arises from a difficult reality: the material and social conditions that once sustained this romantic form of awakening have largely disappeared.

In the film, repression is primarily value-based—patriarchy, tradition, authority. In the present, particularly within systems dominated by meritocracy and instrumental rationality, repression manifests more as structural occupation. Time is thoroughly appropriated. Evaluation systems are radically singular. Individuals are continuously required to conform to efficiency, outcomes, and quantifiable metrics. In such an environment, people are not so much “educated” as they are dispatched; subjectivity is not cultivated but compressed into discrete, measurable functions.

This marks the fundamental difference between the film’s setting and our own. A Keating-style “awakening” presupposes that the awakened subject retains some margin of agency—enough to bear the cost of awakening. In reality, especially in environments where meaningful choice is nearly absent, premature or excessive humanistic enlightenment may not liberate but instead deepen despair. To recognize one’s own value while confronting an immovable structure is itself a profound psychological risk. Even beyond education, the dilemma persists. The extreme division of labor and systemic integration of modern society leave most people with little time, energy, or space to understand themselves, much less to realize a so-called “life’s purpose.” Meaning is outsourced to position, income, performance, and social evaluation. As the world operates smoothly, it simultaneously alienates those within it.

In this context, the line “the soul has no prosthesis” becomes especially jarring. Reality seems to whisper otherwise: the soul can indeed be fitted with prosthetics—perhaps even replaced altogether. A person may remain dull to questions of meaning, highly instrumentalized in spirit, and still achieve conventional success—perhaps even more readily so. More troubling than the acceptance of this condition is its moralization. It is labeled maturity, rationality, realism; it is packaged as the “correct choice.” Spiritual numbness ceases to be a loss and becomes a virtue. Reflection is dismissed as affectation, sensitivity as inefficiency, suffering as weakness.

An ethical inversion thus emerges. We instinctively recognize that invoking physical disability to deny someone’s agency is lacking in empathy. Yet when spiritual numbness, the abandonment of self, and the erosion of reflective capacity are framed as “adaptation,” “progress,” or “rational choice,” they are often treated as a consensus of the age. The capacity for spiritual agency quietly loses its ethical standing: it is no longer protected but mocked, disciplined, even urged toward relinquishment.

It must be acknowledged that, descriptively speaking, this hierarchy of values is internally coherent. Modern society does not require most individuals to maintain high degrees of spiritual integrity; it prefers subjects who are low-friction, predictable, and minimally conflicted. Integrity is no longer a functional necessity. That does not render it worthless. Rather, its value shifts—from functional to individual, even negative in the philosophical sense: a value defined by refusal.

This leads to a more sober conclusion. If one recognizes that this ethical inversion cannot be corrected, then choosing to relinquish integrity with a clear conscience is not a moral failure but a legitimate act of self-preservation. Courage should never be treated as an obligation. Those willing to bear the cost of maintaining spiritual agency are not thereby nobler or superior; they have simply chosen to assume greater risk. Courage is a capacity, not a standard.

In this sense, the question posed in *A Clockwork Orange*—whether a person deprived of the capacity for choice remains fully human—has mutated. Today the harsher question is not whether integrity is taken away, but whether integrity itself is still regarded as valuable. The answer may be that, for society, it is not necessary; for the individual, however, once wholly abandoned, it becomes difficult to distinguish between living and being used.

It is precisely here that *Dead Poets Society* retains a faint yet genuine relevance. It no longer asks us to stand upon our desks, nor does it encourage overt rebellion. Instead, it suggests that even in an age that does not require courage, one may still preserve a space not entirely annexed by the system. This space need not manifest as outward action. It may exist as a minimal form of inner sovereignty:

To know that one is being structurally utilized, without mistaking that utilization for the entirety of the self;

To allow the question of meaning to persist, without rushing to supply utilitarian answers;

To adapt and even to relinquish, while refusing to participate in narratives that rebrand spiritual regression as progress.

This is neither romanticism nor heroism, but restrained self-preservation.

Perhaps this is the true significance of rereading *Dead Poets Society*: not to replicate its gestures, but to refuse, even within a sober recognition of reality, to surrender the authority to define one’s own integrity. Even if such integrity cannot be converted into success or rewarded by society, it preserves at least the possibility of not being entirely alienated. In an era in which systems function efficiently yet ask less and less what it means to be human, such preservation is already a serious act.
