## Statement of Purpose

With the rapid proliferation of heterogeneous wireless and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, achieving energy efficiency and service quality has become increasingly challenging in space–air–ground integrated networks. The highly dynamic network topology and complex heterogeneous network states present significant challenges for network resource management and task scheduling. Therefore, designing efficient algorithms for such systems is of great research value. Simultaneously, my research interests lie in optimization theory, online learning, especially sequential decision-making algorithms. I believe these techniques are useful tools for addressing the above challenges.

During my undergraduate studies, I developed a strong interest in theoretical computer science (TCS). Driven by this enthusiasm, I participated in many competitive programming competitions and won some awards. These experiences gave me a solid foundation in algorithms and optimization theory. Later, I conducted research on space-air-ground integrated networks. In this research, I utilized the Lyapunov optimization framework, combined with convex optimization algorithms and the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm of multi-armed bandits, and proposed an online algorithm for jointly optimizing energy consumption and data offloading. Through this work, I learned some concepts of online learning and the model of multi-armed bandits, and developed a strong interest in them. In subsequent research, I applied the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithm with combinatorial optimization methods to solve a combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem, thereby gaining deeper insight into the theoretical foundations of online learning algorithms.

In the future, I hope to further study optimization theory, online learning and various machine learning algorithms, and to explore their applications in real-world scenarios.
