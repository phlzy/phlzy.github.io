January 2026: I happened to come across something I wrote three years ago. I have revised it slightly and translated it using GPT.

I used to love reading. Even at my busiest, I could always carve out time for it. From demanding novels such as *Fortress Besieged*, *One Hundred Years of Solitude*, and *The Unbearable Lightness of Being*, to more familiar classics like *Ninety-Three*, *The Moon and Sixpence*, and *The Thorn Birds*, and then to popular fiction by Jin Yong, Agatha Christie, and Keigo Higashino—reading was like breathing. It required no justification.

At some point, that habit disappeared. It is difficult to pinpoint the cause. In any case, for many years I hardly touched literature in any form. Perhaps I would watch one or two anime series, and only after finishing them would a faint echo linger in my mind.

Then, on one occasion, a close friend who knows me well recommended that I read *The Demon Blade Chronicles*. Both of us are fond of the prose styles of Jin Yong and Liang Yusheng, whose lines are imbued with historical and literary depth. Perhaps for that reason he believed I would appreciate the novel. Perhaps for the same reason, I had long harbored strong prejudices against much of the popular fiction circulating online—many writers lack basic literary cultivation or sufficient training, and their works can be genuinely unreadable.

*The Demon Blade Chronicles* is one of the few exceptions that altered my view. Although it does not quite reach the density and gravitas of Jin Yong, the author is clearly committed to recreating the distinctive flavor of traditional wuxia. That alone commands respect. The prose is refined, the martial arts techniques vividly rendered, and the multi-threaded narrative structurally ambitious. Most commendable, however, is the overarching design of the plot. As the saying goes, “like a hidden thread running through ashes and serpent tracks,” seemingly insignificant remarks or relationships introduced early on resurface much later. This long-range foreshadowing is a testament to the author’s craftsmanship.

The novel’s shortcomings are equally apparent. Its expansive world-building and numerous characters increase the difficulty of sustaining the narrative in the middle and later stages, and the multi-linear structure amplifies this challenge. In the latter half, one can clearly feel the slowing of narrative momentum as the author works to flesh out the cast; once certain plotlines are spread out, they prove difficult to resolve with precision. As for the sexual content, I am inclined to think that much of it serves reader demand rather than character development, and unfortunately it becomes a significant drag on the pacing.

Even so, *The Demon Blade Chronicles* remains a lengthy work worth reading. Looking back now, however, my evaluation of the text itself is not the main point. The point is that reading this novel felt like a ritual of renewal. After finishing it, I regained my former reading pace, and reading returned to my life. From Gu Long’s *Meteor, Butterfly, Sword* to Liang Yusheng’s *The Jade Bow in the Cloud Sea*; from *Jerusalem: The Biography* to *The Sword of Persia: Nader Shah, from Tribal Warrior to Conquering Tyrant*; from *On the Road* to *The Razor’s Edge*—reading is not a way of consuming time, but of reclaiming it.
